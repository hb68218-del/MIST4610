# 🏈 MIST 4610 — SEC College Football Stats Tracker  
**Group 6 | University of Georgia, Terry College of Business**

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This project was developed for **MIST 4610: Data Management & Analytics** to demonstrate end-to-end database design and SQL query analysis.  

Our team designed and implemented a relational database system to track **SEC College Football statistics** for the 2024–2025 season. The project simulates how a data-driven sports management system can help stakeholders (e.g., coaches, league managers, and analysts) make informed decisions regarding team performance, referee allocation, and stadium operations.  

The database allows for:
- Efficient storage and retrieval of player, team, referee, and game data  
- Managerial insights through SQL-based analytical queries  
- Visualization of relationships between entities through an ERD  

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Design a **normalized relational database** (3NF) for SEC football operations  
- Build and forward-engineer the database schema using **MySQL Workbench**  
- Populate the database with realistic data and verify integrity constraints  
- Develop **10 SQL queries** (6 complex, 4 simple) that deliver managerial insights  
- Document all entities, attributes, and relationships in a **data dictionary**  
- Present final results and analysis through query screenshots and reasoning
